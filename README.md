# Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling
## Project Description
Ssoftware application designed to process and visualize audio data, providing users with interactive tools to analyze various aspects of sound. By leveraging signal processing techniques, the tool enables users to examine waveforms, spectrograms, and RT60 graphs in real-time, enhancing the understanding of complex acoustic properties. 

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of a course on audio processing and visualization. It was created for the need for an intuitive, easy-to-use platform for analyzing audio data, with the flexibility to visualize different frequency bands and acoustic features such as the RT60 decay time. The tool is designed to be both educational and functional, providing insight into the technical aspects of audio.

## Features
- **Waveform Plot**: Visualize the amplitude of an audio file over time.
- **Spectrogram**: Display a spectrogram of the audio file to analyze frequency content.
- **RT60 Graphs**: Visualize the decay of sound energy across different frequency bands (low, mid, high).
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily load and interact with audio files through a simple user interface.
